Pseudocode Of K-Means
START
READ input data
CALCULATE numbers of input data
INITIALIZE value of k
INITIALIZE maximum iterations, target accuracy, and total distance
INITIALIZE label for data
INITIALIZE centers
REPEAT
	GROUP each data to label with the nearest centers
	CALCULATE new centers as the mean of its members
	CALCULATE current accuracy
	INCREMENT iterations
UNTIL (iterations>maximum iterations OR accuracy>target accuracy OR minimal distance are obtained)

Pseudocode of Moving K-Means
START
READ input data
CALCULATE numbers of input data
INITIALIZE value of k
INITIALIZE iterations, maximum iterations, target accuracy, and total distance
INITIALIZE label for data
INITIALIZE centers
INITIALIZE alpha0, alphaA and alphaB where alpha0=alphaA=alphaB where 0<alpha0<1/3
SET all of alpha with same value
GROUP each data to label with the nearest centers
CALCULATE new centers as the mean of its members
REPEAT
		CALCULATE fitness of each centre using distance function
		REPEAT
			FIND the centre with smallest and largest value of fitness
			IF smallestFitness < alphaA*largestFitness
				IF members of largestFitness's label <largestFitness's centre
					CHANGE that members's label to smallestFitness's label
				CALCULATE new smallestFitness's label and largestFitness's label with the mean of its members
			CALCULATE alphaA = alphaA - alphaA/number of labels
		UNTIL smallesFitness >= alphaA*largestFitness
	GROUP each data to label with the nearest centers
	CALCULATE new centers as the mean of its members
	CALCULATE alphaA = alpha0 and alphaB=alphaB-alphaB/number of labels
	INCREMENT iterations
UNTIL (smallesFitness >= alphaB * largestFitness OR iterations > maximum iterations OR accuracy > target accuracy OR minimal distance are obtained)
