Pseudocode Of K-Means

START
READ input data
CALCULATE numbers of input data
INITIALIZE value of k
INITIALIZE maximum iterations, target accuracy, and total distance
INITIALIZE label for data
REPEAT
	INITIALIZE and CALCULATE centers
	GROUP each data to label with the nearest centers
	CALCULATE new centers
	CALCULATE current accuracy
	INCREMENT iterations
UNTIL (iterations<=maximum iterations or accuracy<=target accuracy)
STOP
